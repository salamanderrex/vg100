UMJI VG100 project in 2011 Fall semester
#Semi-auto Shelf
-------------------------------------------------
A Design of Semi-auto Shelf for exhibition in libraries, expos or museums

#Function
---------------------------------------------------
Function:
* 1. Put the right hand in front of the right IR-switch and don’t move it , the semi-automatic self will spin in clockwise
* 2. Put the left hand in front of the left IR-switch and don’t move it , the semi-automatic self will spin in anticlockwise
* 3. Move the hand from the left IR-switch to the right IR switch, the semi-automatic self will spin automatically 
* 4. When the Move the hand from the right IR-switch to the left IR switch, the semi-automatic self will stop spinning. 


# Design
-------------------------------------------------
Our semi-automatic shelf has a hexagon shell and a shelf with three plates where things like books can be put. The hexagon shell and plates are made by polymethyl- methacrylate (PMMA). The self-pillar itself is actually a linear incandescent lamp. The pillar is link with a DC motor at the end with a long screw to fix them. The DC motor will spin the pillar at a constant speed. Two top lights are place at the top of the shell. At the bottom of the shell, there are three switches. From the left to the right, the first switch controls the top lights and the second switch is useless (originally is used to control the AC motor to control the shelf) and the third switch is used to control the two top lights. The IR-switches are placed on the hexagon shell and it can determine whether there is a thing before it. When the IR-switch get signal, it will make the DC motor run and rotate the pillar.
